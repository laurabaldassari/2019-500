# 2019-500

This is the main Web Site for all materials related to PQHS 500 in Spring 2019. 

## Changes to the Class Since Class 01

For a variety of reasons (mostly that we will only meet 12 times, and that we have 26 students) several changes to the course were necessary. The highlights:

- The [Course Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md) is now up to date on all deliverables, deadlines, and specifies what we'll be talking about in each of our class sessions.
- Several changes have been made to the [Project](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/tree/master/projects). You'll notice, for instance, that Project Presentations will be held in classes 10, 11 and 12, not just 11 and 12. I've also decided to allow people to work on the Project in groups of two, if they want to.
- The Observational Studies in Action assignment has been cancelled for 2019.
- Many other deadlines have been moved around. I've tried to update everything on the web site accordingly. If I missed something, please let me know. Again, the [Course Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md) is where I will go to resolve any discrepancies. I've also updated Canvas regarding any deliverables that go there.

## Our First Class

Our first class will be **2019-01-24 at 8:30 AM** in Wolstein Research Building, room 1217. Please be on time, and bring a laptop. Before our first class you need to:

1. Read the [Course Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-500-syllabus/) and also familiarize yourself with the contents of this web site.
2. Obtain and read the preface and Chapters 1 and 2 of the book by Rosenbaum described below, and
3. Download and install necessary software to a computer you control (ideally the laptop you will bring to class).

### The Book You Need For Our First Class

The book we're reading together this semester is Paul Rosenbaum's *Observation and Experiment: An Introduction to Causal Inference*, published in 2017 by Harvard University Press. The ISBN-13 number is 978-0674975576. The book is available electronically or in hardcover from Amazon and other retailers.

- Buy the book, and read the **Preface** as well as **Chapters 1 and 2**, *before* our first class meeting on 2019-01-24.
- We'll read the rest of the book according to the [Course Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md).

PDFs of many supplementary texts are found [in our texts folder](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/tree/master/texts). Some are password-protected, and we will learn the password in our first class on 2019-01-24.

### The Software You'll Need

The course uses R, R Studio and R Markdown, as were used in 431-432. Get your software up to date on a laptop you can bring to class, for best results. We'll hope you have all of this done before the first class, but if you have problems, we can deal with them at that session. You'll need to have all of this accomplished in order to do your first homework assignment, which is due 2019-01-31.

1. Download R (R 3.5.2 or later) from https://cran.case.edu/. Everything should still work as long as you have version 3.5.0 or later, but it's best to start out in the same place as everyone else.
2. Download R Studio Desktop (open source edition: version 1.1.463 or later is OK) from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download.
3. Install the necessary R [software packages we'll use](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/PACKAGES.md).

- If you need additional installation instructions, we recommend using [Dr. Love's 431 instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/software), or [these Stat 545 instructions](https://stat545.com/block000_r-rstudio-install.html).

## Getting Help

- Dr. Love is available by email at `Thomas dot Love at case dot edu`. He is out of town 2019-01-14 through 2019-01-18.
- Once class begins, he will be available on Thursdays from 11 AM to noon for discussion / office hours. Should you need to set up an appointment at another time, please contact him via email.

## One Last Thing

If you are interested in and capable of audio-recording the class, please let Dr. Love know.
