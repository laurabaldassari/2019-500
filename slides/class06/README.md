## Project Details

The Google Sheet at http://bit.ly/500-2019-project-list contains detailed information on each project proposal that I have approved. Please take a look at the title, data source, outcome and type of outcome, exposure, and covariate information I have listed there, and ensure that it matches your understanding of what I've approved. If it does not, please let me know by the end of class today, in person.
