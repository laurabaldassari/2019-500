## NEW! A nice tutorial on "positivity" and what it means

- Ellie Murray (@EpiEllie on Twitter) posted a [nice causal inference explainer to Twitter on positivity](https://twitter.com/EpiEllie/status/1089219830052474880).

> If you are interested in understanding causal effects from data, then you need to understand the concept of positivity. This article explains what this means and why itâ€™s important.

## Another interesting problem with some "research"?

[Vince Buffalo](https://twitter.com/vsbuffalo/status/1091790085610065920?s=11) made a number of interesting points in a tweet about Julia Belluz' article in Vox from 2019-02-01, entitled "[Eating breakfast is not a good weight loss strategy, scientists confirm](https://www.vox.com/2019/2/1/18206873/breakfast-diet-weight-loss)".
