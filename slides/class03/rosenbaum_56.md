# Comments on Rosenbaum, Chapters 5-6

## Most Important Thing

- **Simpson's Paradox**
- Definition/Description of the PS, Visualization of the four methods for using PS
- Use of stratification to show effects that might not appear across strata
- Matching and stratification's advantages 
- Balancing multiple covariates at once
- Recognizing the non-random nature of natural experiments

## Muddy Things

- How to handle concordant or discordant theories
- When to use **stratification vs. matching vs. weighting vs. regression adjustment** vs. "double robust" strategies
- When natural experiments actually have enough of the attributes that we would want to see if they were randomized? When is a natural experiment actually useful?
- What is the role of aliasing, as compared to confounding? Should we care?
- Does discarding unmatched individuals lead to a bias?
