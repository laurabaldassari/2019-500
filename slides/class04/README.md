# 500 Class 04: 2019-02-28

- There are no slides for Class 4.
- We will post the audio recording above, as soon as we can.

Remember that your [Chapter 7 Essay](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/assignments/essayprompts.md) is due today at noon.

## Upcoming Deliverables: The Project Proposal

- Remember that your project proposal is due next Thursday 2019-03-05. The [Course Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md) is the place to go for all deadlines and deliverables information. 
- I have provided feedback on the first drafts for all proposals. You'll find that in Canvas, and we'll [also discuss the material at this link](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/projects/proposal/README.md).

You'll also need to complete the [Project Scheduling Form](http://bit.ly/500-2019-project-scheduling-form) by 2019-03-05, as well.

## The "toy" Example

The 2019 version of the toy example [is described here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/tree/master/data-and-code/toy_example). I'll be semi-live coding in class.

The zipped folder containing everything I did in the live session is now available.

## Today, we will discuss...

1. [The toy example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/tree/master/data-and-code/toy_example)
2. Your project proposals, and [my reactions to them](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/projects/proposal/README.md)
3. Rosenbaum, Chapter 7 (maybe, but probably not).
