# 500 Class 02: 2019-01-31

- The slides for Class 2 are [now available in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/slides/class01/500_2019_slides_class02.pdf).
- We will post the audio recording above, as soon as we can.
- The [Course Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md) is the place to go for all deadlines and deliverables information. 

# CLASS POSTPONED DUE TO COLD

Due to the cold, you've probably heard that the University is closed from 7 PM on Tuesday 2019-01-29 through 7 PM on Thursday 2019-01-31. This means, naturally, that Class 02 of our 500 course will not be held on Thursday 2019-01-31. By the end of the day on Monday 2019-02-04, I expect to have the web site to accommodate this change. Let's go with this for now:

- All deadlines currently listed on the web site for the 500 course will be reconsidered between now and the end of the day on Monday 2019-02-04. I won't move anything earlier, but I may or may not move things later.
- Homework 1 is now due at noon on Friday 2019-02-01, so that's pushed back one day (it was originally due this Thursday at noon).
- We'll hold Class 02 on Thursday 2019-02-07, and your reading for that session remains Rosenbaum - preface and Chapters 1-4. Homework 2 will be postponed, so it is not due on 2019-02-07.

That's all I can commit to for now. I'll send an email once I've cleaned up everything on the web page.

## NEW! A nice tutorial on "positivity" and what it means

- Ellie Murray (@EpiEllie on Twitter) posted a [nice causal inference explainer to Twitter on positivity](https://twitter.com/EpiEllie/status/1089219830052474880).

> If you are interested in understanding causal effects from data, then you need to understand the concept of positivity. This article explains what this means and why itâ€™s important.
