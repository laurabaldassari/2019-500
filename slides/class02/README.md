## NEW! A nice tutorial on "positivity" and what it means

- Ellie Murray (@EpiEllie on Twitter) posted a [nice causal inference explainer to Twitter on positivity](https://twitter.com/EpiEllie/status/1089219830052474880).

> If you are interested in understanding causal effects from data, then you need to understand the concept of positivity. This article explains what this means and why it’s important.
