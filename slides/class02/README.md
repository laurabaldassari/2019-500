# 500 Class 02: 2019-02-07

- The slides for Class 2 are [now available in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/slides/class01/500_2019_slides_class02.pdf).
- We will post the audio recording above, as soon as we can.
- The [Course Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md) is the place to go for all deadlines and deliverables information. 

## Changes to the Class Since Class 01

For a variety of reasons (mostly that we will only meet 12 times, and that we have 26 students) several changes to the course were necessary. The "highlights":

- The [Course Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md) is now up to date on all deliverables, deadlines, and specifies what we'll be talking about in each of our class sessions.
- Several changes have been made to the Project. You'll notice, for instance, that Project Presentations will be held in classes 10, 11 and 12, not just 11 and 12. I've also decided to allow people to work on the Project in groups of two, if they want to, and I've given you deadlines for both the initial draft of the project proposal and a second, final draft of that proposal. You'll also need to fill out [this form to schedule your presentation](http://bit.ly/500-2019-project-scheduling-form).
- The Observational Studies in Action assignment has been cancelled for 2019.
- Many other deadlines have been moved around. I've tried to update everything on the web site accordingly. If I missed something, please let me know. Again, the [Course Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md) is where I will go to resolve any discrepancies. I've also updated Canvas regarding any deliverables that go there.

## Today, we will discuss...

- A Motivating Example on Aspirin and Mortality based on the Gum paper, linked on [our Texts page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/texts/README.md)
- [Homework 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/tree/master/assignments/homework1), especially Questions 2 and 3
- The Hormone Replacement Therapy Story
- Rosenbaum *Observation and Experiment* Preface and Chapters 1-4
- Tools for Assessing Causal Effects
- Cochran's Smoking Example
- Why Propensity Scores?

## NEW! A nice tutorial on "positivity" and what it means

- Ellie Murray (@EpiEllie on Twitter) posted a [nice causal inference explainer to Twitter on positivity](https://twitter.com/EpiEllie/status/1089219830052474880).

> If you are interested in understanding causal effects from data, then you need to understand the concept of positivity. This article explains what this means and why itâ€™s important.
