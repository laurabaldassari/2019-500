# 500 Class 02: 2019-02-07

- The slides for Class 2 are [now available in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/slides/class02/500_2019_slides_class02.pdf).
- The audio recording is now posted, above. Sorry for the delay.
- The [Course Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md) is the place to go for all deadlines and deliverables information. 

## Changes to the Class Since Class 01

For a variety of reasons (mostly that we will only meet 12 times, and that we have ~26~ 25 students) several changes to the course were necessary. The "highlights":

- The [Course Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md) is now up to date on all deliverables, deadlines, and specifies what we'll be talking about in each of our class sessions.
- Several changes have been made to the [Project](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/tree/master/projects). You'll notice, for instance, that 
    - Project Presentations will be held during classes 10, 11 and 12, not just 11 and 12. 
    - I've decided to allow people to work on the Project in groups of two, if they want to, so long as they email me by 2019-02-14,
    - I've given you deadlines for both the initial draft of the project proposal and a second, final draft of that proposal. 
    - Complete [this form to schedule your end-of-semester presentation](http://bit.ly/500-2019-project-scheduling-form) by March 5 at Noon.
- The Observational Studies in Action assignment has been cancelled for 2019.
- Many other deadlines have been moved around. I've tried to update everything on the web site accordingly. If I missed something, please let me know. Again, the [Course Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md) is where I will go to resolve any discrepancies. I've also updated Canvas regarding any deliverables that go there.

## Today, we will discuss...

- A Motivating Example on Aspirin and Mortality based on the Gum paper, linked on [our Texts page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/texts/README.md)
- The Hormone Replacement Therapy Story
- Assessing Causal Effects with Subclassification: Cochran's Smoking Example
- [Homework 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/tree/master/assignments/homework1), especially Questions 2 and 3
- Rosenbaum *Observation and Experiment* Preface and Chapters 1-4
- Why Propensity Scores?
- Using Matched Sets to Adjust for Overt Bias

## Local EpiBookClub starts this afternoon

A group of students, led by Laurie Ann Moennich and Wyatt Bensken, are reading Kieran Healy's [Data Visualization](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Visualization-Introduction-Kieran-Healy/dp/0691181624/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1549469746&sr=8-1&keywords=kieran+healy) this semester. The first meeting of the group will be held today (2019-02-07) from 2:30 - 3:30 PM in Wood WG82-C. They'll discuss the Preface and Chapters 1-2. You're asked to bring yourself and your laptop. I understand snacks are involved. The book is available online at http://socviz.co/, or you can purchase a hard copy through Amazon or other retailers. If you're interested, just show up, or email Laurie Ann at lxm303 or Wyatt at wpb27.
