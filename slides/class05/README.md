# 500 Class 05: 2019-03-07

- Materials for Class 5 will be posted soon.
- We will post the audio recording above, as soon as we can.

## Deliverables

1. The "final" version of your [Project Proposal](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/tree/master/projects/proposal) is due today at noon. Don't forget to complete the [Project Presentation Scheduling Form](http://bit.ly/500-2019-project-scheduling-form), as well.
    - The dates for the project presentations are all on Thursdays: April 18, April 25 and May 2. I had the last date wrong on the form, and when I fixed it, some people's checks disappeared (I let them know via email.)
    - We have 25 students in the class, and 22 projects in total to hear. So we'll do 8 one day and 7 on the other two days. 
    - When your grade on the Project Proposal (Final Version) on Canvas is 10, I'm satisfied and your proposal is approved. Your next task is to do the project, and your next deliverable regarding the project is the [Project Update](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/tree/master/projects/update) due at the start of April.
2. Due to CWRU Spring Break, our next class will be 2019-03-21, and we'll discuss sensitivity analysis for matched samples. Due that day (at noon) are [Homework 3](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/tree/master/assignments/homework3) and [Chapter 8 Essay](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/assignments/essayprompts.md).
    - [Homework 3](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/tree/master/assignments/homework3) requires you to do several tasks we did with the `toy` data last week, using a new (simulated) data set. This includes unadjusted outcome analyses (on two binary outcomes), fitting a straightforward main-effects-only propensity model to balance eight covariates, estimating Rubin's Rules 1 and 2 prior to propensity adjustment, using direct adjustment for the (logit of the) propensity score, using subclassification by propensity score quintile, and matching 1:1 without replacement, then comparing the results on one of the two outcomes after adjustment to the unadjusted estimate. It will take a while to get all of that done, so I encourage you to get started soon.
    - Chapter 8 of Rosenbaum is about Quasi-Experimental Devices, including the use of multiple control groups, control by systematic variation, counterparts and control outcomes. There's also a little discussion of discontinuity designs. [The required essay](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/assignments/essayprompts.md#prompt-for-chapter-8-quasi-experimental-devices-due-for-class-6) asks you to describe a setting where multiple control groups could be used productively.

## Rosenbaum Essays after Chapter 7

I've gathered some comments (and a few examples of your writing) about elaborate theories and their role in designing and developing compelling observational studies [here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/tree/master/assignments/essay07). Please take a look.
