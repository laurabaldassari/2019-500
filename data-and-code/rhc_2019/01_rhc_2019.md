# Preliminaries

## Study Background

This example is based on the Right Heart Catheterization data set
available at [Vanderbilt
University](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/DataSets) and
described
[here](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/rhc.html).
The key reference is Connors AF et al. 1996 The effectiveness of RHC in
the initial care of critically ill patients. [*JAMA* 276:
889-897](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/407990).
Connors et al. used a logistic regression model to develop a propensity
score then: \[a\] matched RHC to non-RHC patients and \[b\] adjusted for
propensity score in models for outcomes, followed by a sensitivity
analysis. The key conclusions were that RHC patients had decreased
survival time, and any unmeasured confounder would have to be somewhat
strong to explain away the results.

## Loading Packages

``` r
library(here); library(janitor); library(naniar)
library(tableone); library(broom); library(survival)
library(Matching); library(cobalt); library(rgenoud)
library(lme4); library(rbounds)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Importing the Data

The observations in the `rhc` data set describe 5,735 subjects who are
critically ill, and most variables were obtained during day 1 of a
hospitalization. We’ll begin by importing the `rhc` data into a
**tibble** (a lazy and surly data frame - see R’s help file on tibbles
for more details) in R that contains 5,735 observations (rows) on 63
variables (columns).

In the import process, we’re going to do a few things to simplify the
process of getting a functional data set.

  - The automated column specification in R’s **readr** package uses the
    first 1000 rows of the data set - with the `rhc` data, this creates
    parsing failures for several measures which are assumed to be
    integers but actually should be parsed as doubles (continuous
    variables). So we specify the column types for those variables here
    then allow R to identify the type for the other columns.
  - By default, **readr**’s `read_csv` command treats all string
    variables as characters, and not as factors. For several
    multicategorical variables, we want a factor representation in a
    specific order, so we’ll specify that, too, also using the `cols`
    function.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
column_types_rhc <- 
    cols(urin1 = "d", meanbp1 = "d", resp1 = "d",
    swang1 = col_factor(c("RHC", "No RHC")),
    death = col_factor(c("No", "Yes")),
    sex = col_factor(c("Male", "Female")),
    cat1 = col_factor(c("ARF", "CHF", "Cirrhosis", "Colon Cancer", "Coma", "COPD",
                        "Lung Cancer", "MOSF w/Malignancy", "MOSF w/Sepsis")),
    dnr1 = col_factor(c("No", "Yes")),
    card = col_factor(c("No", "Yes")),
    gastr = col_factor(c("No", "Yes")),
    hema = col_factor(c("No", "Yes")),
    meta = col_factor(c("No", "Yes")),
    neuro = col_factor(c("No", "Yes")),
    ortho = col_factor(c("No", "Yes")),
    renal = col_factor(c("No", "Yes")),
    resp = col_factor(c("No", "Yes")),
    seps = col_factor(c("No", "Yes")),
    trauma = col_factor(c("No", "Yes")),
    income = col_factor(c("Under $11k", "$11-$25k", "$25-$50k", "> $50k")),
    ninsclas = col_factor(c("Private", "Private & Medicare", "Medicare", 
                             "Medicare & Medicaid", "Medicaid", "No insurance")),
    race = col_factor(c("white", "black", "other")),
    ca = col_factor(c("No", "Yes", "Metastatic"))
)

rhc_raw <- read_csv("http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/rhc.csv", 
                    col_types = column_types_rhc)
```

    Warning: Missing column names filled in: 'X1' [1]

  - After we import the data, we re-order the columns to present the
    SUPPORT patient identification code first, then the exposure
    (`swang1`), then information on the outcomes, then information on
    the covariates of interest for our work, dropping the other
    variables.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
rhc_cleaning <- rhc_raw %>% 
    select(ptid, swang1, 
           death, sadmdte, dschdte, dthdte, lstctdte,
           age, sex, edu, income, ninsclas, race,

## The Data Set after Initial Import

The `rhc_cleaning` data at this stage is a tibble (a lazy and surly data
frame) containing 5735 observations (rows) on 57 variables (columns).
The observations describe subjects who are critically ill, and most
variables were obtained during day 1 of a hospitalization.

We could also graph this with `gg_miss_var(rhc_cleaning)`. As it turns
out, there were three variables in the raw `rhc` data that have missing
values, but we’ve omitted one (about day 1 urine output) in creating
this `rhc_cleaning` file. The remaining two are dates, and we’ll address
those in the material on creating our outcomes.

# The Treatment / Exposure We’ll Study

The treatment/exposure we are studying is the presence of a Swan-Ganz
(right heart) catheter on day 1, captured in the variable `swang1`. The
Medline Plus description of right heart catheterization [is
here](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003870.htm). Basically, the
procedure passes a thin tube into the right side of the heart and the
arteries leading to the lungs, to measure the heart’s function and blood
flow. It’s done in very ill patients for several reasons, and is also
referred to as right heart catheterization and pulmonary artery
catheterization.

``` r
rhc_cleaning %>% tabyl(swang1)
```

``` 
 swang1    n   percent
    RHC 2184 0.3808195
 No RHC 3551 0.6191805
```

Of course, the most important issue to us is that each subject was not
randomly allocated to either the “RHC” or “No RHC” group. Instead, this
is an **observational** study, where each subject received their
treatment (RHC or no) on the basis of what their providers thought would
be best for them.

# The 3 Outcomes We’ll Study

We will define three outcomes here: one binary, one quantitative, and
one time-to-event.

  - Our first outcome is in-study mortality, captured as a binary
    variable.
  - We will then define hospital length of stay, a quantitative
    variable, and then
  - Time to death, a time-to-event variable that will be right-censored
    for those who did not die during the study.

## Mortality, a binary outcome: `death`

One outcome is death during the study, as captured in the `death`
variable. This is a **binary** outcome.

``` r
rhc_cleaning %>% tabyl(death)
```

``` 
 death    n   percent
    No 2013 0.3510026
   Yes 3722 0.6489974
```

Those people without a value for `dthdte` turn out to be the people with
`death` values of “No” and this makes sense, because `dthdte` is a code
for date of
death.

## Working with Dates to Define the Time-Related Outcomes

### The Raw Data on Dates

| Variable   | Definition              | Values                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sadmdte`  | Study Admission Date    | Integer ranging from 10754 to 12441, indicating the \# of days after 1960-01-01, so study admission date range is actually 1989-06-11 to 1994-01-23.                                                              |
| `dschdte`  | Hospital Discharge Date | Integer ranging from 10757 to 12560, indicating the \# of days after 1960-01-01, so hospital discharge date range is actually 1989-06-14 to 1994-05-22. (**Note: 1 missing value**)                               |
| `dthdte`   | Death Date              | Integer ranging from 10757 to 12783, indicating the \# of days after 1960-01-01, so death date range is actually 1989-06-14 to 1994-12-31. The **2013 people with missing values** are those with No for `death`. |
| `lstctdte` | Date of Last Contact    | Integer ranging from 10756 to 12644, indicating the \# of days after 1960-01-01, so death date range is actually 1989-06-13 to 1994-08-14.                                                                        |

Next, we will develop the two other primary outcomes: survival time
(which we’ll store in `survdays`), and hospital length of stay (which
will go in `hospdays`).

  - It turns out that for three subjects, their dates of last contact
    appear to occur after their death dates, which is irritating, but
    doesn’t affect us much since the only way in which we’ll use the
    last contact date is for calculating survival time for patients
    *without* a death date.

### Impute hospital discharge date for the one missing value

We could just impute a random value, but that’s not a great idea, since
hospital discharge date is tied to other information that is available
to us for this patient. The subject with a missing hospital discharge
date turns out to be `ptid` 08382.

``` r
rhc_cleaning %>% filter(is.na(dschdte)) %>% 
    select(ptid, death, sadmdte, dschdte, dthdte, lstctdte)
```

    1 08382 Yes     12386      NA  12780    12582

So the patient was admitted to the study on day 12386, had their last
contact with the study on day 12582 (i.e. 196 days after study entry),
and died on day 12780 (i.e. 394 days after study entry.) It seems
rational to impute a value of hospital discharge date that falls in
between their date of study admission and their date of last contact.

  - Among the RHC patients, what is a reasonable guess as to the time
    from study admission to hospital discharge that we might apply to
    this patient? We could see what the distribution of these
    differences are in the available data, like so…

<!-- end list -->

``` r
mosaic::favstats(dschdte - sadmdte ~ swang1, data = rhc_cleaning)
```

``` 
  swang1 min Q1 median Q3 max     mean       sd    n missing
1    RHC   2  8     16 31 342 24.69125 27.80502 2183       1
2 No RHC   2  7     12 22 338 19.52915 23.58672 3551       0
```

I’ll arbitrarily choose to impute a discharge date for `ptid` 08382 so
as to yield a 25 day hospitalization, so as to affect the mean stay
length within the RHC group as little as possible.

This implies that we’ll impute a value of 12386 + 25 = 12411 for this
patient.

``` r
rhc_cleaning <- rhc_cleaning %>%
    mutate(dschdte = replace_na(dschdte, 12411))

rhc_cleaning %>% select(dschdte) %>% miss_var_summary()
```

    # A tibble: 1 x 3
      variable n_miss pct_miss
      <chr>     <int>    <dbl>
    1 dschdte       0        0

## Length of initial hospital stay, a quantitative outcome: `hospdays`

Our third outcome is length of initial hospital stay, which is captured
by subtracting the study admission date (`sadmdte`) from the hospital
discharge date (`dschdte`). This is a **quantitative** outcomes, and we
will create it soon, and name it `hospdays` in our data set.

``` r
rhc_cleaning <- rhc_cleaning %>%
    mutate(hospdays = dschdte - sadmdte)

mosaic::favstats(hospdays ~ swang1, data = rhc_cleaning)
```

``` 
  swang1 min Q1 median Q3 max     mean       sd    n missing
1    RHC   2  8     16 31 342 24.69139 27.79865 2184       0
2 No RHC   2  7     12 22 338 19.52915 23.58672 3551       0
```

It looks like all of these values are reasonable (in that they are all
positive) and we have no missing values.

## Survival Time in Days, a time-to-event outcome: `survdays`

Another outcome is survival time in days (which is censored for all
patients who did not die during the study), and which is captured by
subtracting the study admission date (`sadmdte`) from the death date
(`dthdte`) for the patients who died in study, and the study admission
date (`sadmdte`) from the date of last contact (`lstctdte`) for the
patients who did not die in study. This is a **time-to-event** outcome,
and we will create it soon, and name it `survdays` in our data set.

  - For the subjects who died, this is straightforward, in that we take
    the death date and subtract the study admission date.
  - For those who survived through the study, we take the date of last
    contact and subtract the study admission date, in order to get their
    (right censored) survival times.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
rhc_cleaning <- rhc_cleaning %>%
    mutate(survdays = ifelse(death == "Yes", 
                             dschdte - sadmdte,
                             lstctdte - sadmdte))

mosaic::favstats(survdays ~ death, data = rhc_cleaning)
```

``` 
  death min  Q1 median  Q3  max      mean        sd    n missing
1    No   2 187    210 236 1351 231.18082 112.24989 2013       0
2   Yes   2   6     12  23  338  19.99893  24.59443 3722       0
```

Again, this looks reasonable. All of these values are strictly positive,
for instance, and none seem wildly out of line, and we have no missing
values. We also see that those who died had much shorter survival times
(typically) than those who survived, which makes sense.

We might also look at the `survdays` variable broken down by RHC status.

``` r
mosaic::favstats(survdays ~ swang1, data = rhc_cleaning)
```

``` 
  swang1 min Q1 median  Q3  max     mean       sd    n missing
1    RHC   2  9   25.5 187 1351 91.75962 129.5763 2184       0
2 No RHC   2  9   25.0 191 1243 95.57871 117.7174 3551       0
```

These seem quite comparable, so far, and again, they make sense (all are
positive, and there are no missing values.)

  - Six of these covariates show standardized mean differences larger
    than 0.10.

So, in all, 31 of the 50 covariates show standardized mean differences
that exceed 0.10 before any propensity score adjustment.

# A Little Refactoring

For our outcome, and our treatment, it will be useful to have 1/0
versions of the variables, and it will also be helpful to have the
factor versions releveled to put the outcome of interest (death) first
and the treatment of interest (RHC) first.

``` r
rhc <- rhc_cleaning %>%
    mutate(treat_rhc = as.numeric(swang1 == "RHC"),
           swang1 = fct_relevel(swang1, "RHC"),
           death = fct_relevel(death, "Yes"),
           died = as.numeric(death == "Yes"))
```

## Saving the Data File

``` r
saveRDS(rhc, here("data", "rhc.Rds"))
```

# Unadjusted Outcome Assessments

Before we estimate a propensity score, we’ll perform unadjusted
assessments to describe the impact of RHC (or not) on our three
outcomes, without adjustment for any covariates at all.

## Outcome A: In-Study Mortality (binary)

``` r
rhc %>% tabyl(swang1, death) %>% 
    adorn_totals() %>%
    adorn_percentages() %>%
    adorn_pct_formatting() %>%
    adorn_ns(position = "front") %>%
    adorn_title
```

``` 
               death             
 swang1          Yes           No
    RHC 1486 (68.0%)  698 (32.0%)
 No RHC 2236 (63.0%) 1315 (37.0%)
  Total 3722 (64.9%) 2013 (35.1%)
```

The odds ratio of death associated with RHC as opposed to No RHC should
be larger than 1, specifically, it should be

\[
\frac{1486 \times 1315}{2236 \times 698} = 1.25
\]

Let’s see if that’s what we get.

### Fitting the Model with the 1/0 treatment and outcome

``` r
death_unadj <- glm(died ~ treat_rhc, data = rhc, family = binomial())

death_unadj
```

``` 

Call:  glm(formula = died ~ treat_rhc, family = binomial(), data = rhc)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)    treat_rhc  
     0.5309       0.2248  

Degrees of Freedom: 5734 Total (i.e. Null);  5733 Residual
Null Deviance:      7433 
Residual Deviance: 7418     AIC: 7422
```

``` r
tidy(death_unadj, conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate = TRUE)
```

    # A tibble: 2 x 7
      term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value conf.low conf.high
      <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
    1 (Intercept)     1.70    0.0348     15.3  1.11e-52     1.59      1.82
    2 treat_rhc       1.25    0.0576      3.90 9.43e- 5     1.12      1.40

### Fitting the Model with the treatment and outcome as factors requires care

Alternatively, we could just work with the factors, but then, it’s
important to be sure what is actually being modeled. Do this by making
the outcome and treatment logical results, as
follows.

``` r
modelA_unadj1 <- glm((death == "Yes") ~ (swang1 == "RHC"), data = rhc, family = binomial())

tidy(modelA_unadj1, conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate = TRUE)
```

    # A tibble: 2 x 7
      term             estimate std.error statistic  p.value conf.low conf.high
      <chr>               <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
    1 (Intercept)          1.70    0.0348     15.3  1.11e-52     1.59      1.82
    2 "swang1 == \"RH~     1.25    0.0576      3.90 9.43e- 5     1.12      1.40

Failing to do this can cause trouble:

``` r
modelA_unadj_bad <- glm(death ~ swang1, data = rhc, family = binomial())

tidy(modelA_unadj_bad, conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate = TRUE)
```

    # A tibble: 2 x 7
      term         estimate std.error statistic  p.value conf.low conf.high
      <chr>           <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
    1 (Intercept)     0.470    0.0459    -16.5  6.32e-61    0.429     0.514
    2 swang1No RHC    1.25     0.0576      3.90 9.43e- 5    1.12      1.40 

Note that this last version is actually predicting “Death = No” on the
basis of “swang1 = No RHC”, which can be extremely confusing.

And if you did
this:

``` r
modelA_unadj_bad2 <- glm(death ~ swang1 == "RHC", data = rhc, family = binomial())

tidy(modelA_unadj_bad2, conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate = TRUE)
```

    # A tibble: 2 x 7
      term             estimate std.error statistic  p.value conf.low conf.high
      <chr>               <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
    1 (Intercept)         0.588    0.0348    -15.3  1.11e-52    0.549     0.629
    2 "swang1 == \"RH~    0.799    0.0576     -3.90 9.43e- 5    0.713     0.894

Now, you’ve inverted the odds ratio\! Not good. So, either use 0 and 1
(with 1 being the result you want to study), or use the factors but
specify the direction for both treatment and outcome as a logical
statement.

## Outcome B: Length of Stay (quantitative)

``` r
hospdays_unadj <- glm(hospdays ~ treat_rhc, data = rhc)

hospdays_unadj
```

``` 

Call:  glm(formula = hospdays ~ treat_rhc, data = rhc)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)    treat_rhc  
     19.529        5.162  

Degrees of Freedom: 5734 Total (i.e. Null);  5733 Residual
Null Deviance:      3698000 
Residual Deviance: 3662000  AIC: 53320
```

``` r
tidy(hospdays_unadj, conf.int = TRUE)
```

    # A tibble: 2 x 7
      term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value conf.low conf.high
      <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
    1 (Intercept)    19.5      0.424     46.0  0.          18.7      20.4 
    2 treat_rhc       5.16     0.687      7.51 6.76e-14     3.82      6.51

## Outcome C: Time to death (time-to-event)

Here’s the data on `survdays` and `death` for our first six patients:

``` r
rhc %>% select(survdays, death) %>% head()
```

``` 
# A tibble: 6 x 2
  survdays death
     <dbl> <fct>
1      240 No   
2       45 Yes  
3      317 No   
4       37 Yes  
5        2 Yes  
6      201 No   
```

Here, we have a (right-censored) time to event outcome, called
`survdays`, and an indicator of censoring (`death` which is “Yes” if the
patient’s time is real and not censored). So the first subject should
have a time to death of 240 or more days, because they were still alive
when the study ended, while the second should have a time that is
exactly 45 days, because that person died during the study. The survival
object we need, then,
is:

``` r
Surv(rhc$survdays, rhc$death == "Yes") %>% head()
```

    [1] 240+  45  317+  37    2  201+

rhc %>% select(ptid, ps, linps) %>% head()
```

    # A tibble: 6 x 3

OK. We’re trying to use `ps` to estimate the probability of having a
RHC, and it looks the people who actually had RHC have higher PS, on
average, so that’s promising.

# Checking Rubin’s Rules Prior to Propensity Adjustment

Rubin Rule 1 result should ideally be near 0, and certainly between -50
and +50.

``` r
rubin1.unadj <- with(rhc, 
                  abs(100*(mean(linps[swang1=="RHC"]) - 
                               mean(linps[swang1=="No RHC"]))/
                          sd(linps)))
rubin1.unadj
```

    [1] 101.583

Rubin Rule 2 result should ideally be near 1, and certainly between 1/2
and 2.

``` r
rubin2.unadj <- with(rhc, 
                  var(linps[swang1 == "RHC"]) / 
                      var(linps[swang1 == "No RHC"]))
rubin2.unadj
```

So, we’ve got some work to do. Let’s try matching. In several different
ways.

# Match 3: Genetic Search Matching to do 1:1 Matching without replacement

The `GenMatch` function finds optimal balance using multivariate
matching where a genetic search algorithm determines the weight that
each covariate is given.

Please note that I am using way too small values of `pop.size`
(especially) and probably `max.generations`, too, so that things run
quickly. I am also only matching on the propensity score and linear
propensity score, rather than on the individual covariates. For a course
project, I recommend you try matching on the individual covariates if
you can, but this reduction in the paramater values is fine.

For actual publications, follow the recommendations of the `GenMatch`
algorithm, as described in the `Matching` and `genoud` package help
files. The default values (which may be too small themselves) are 100
for both `pop.size` and `max.generations`.

``` r
Y <- rhc$hospdays
X <- cbind(rhc$linps, rhc$ps)
Tr <- as.logical(rhc$swang1 == "RHC")
genout3 <- GenMatch(Tr = Tr, X = X,
                    estimand = "ATT", M = 1,
                    pop.size = 10, max.generations = 10,
                    wait.generations = 4, verbose = FALSE)

# ATT Matching Estimates for the Binary Outcome, Death

## With Match 1, in detail

Note that the variable which identifies the matches (called `matches_1`)
is set up as a factor, as it needs to be, and that I’m using the 1/0
versions of both the outcome (so `died` rather than `death`) and
treatment (so `treat_rhc` rather than
`swang1`).

``` r
death_adj_m1 <- clogit(died ~ treat_rhc + strata(matches_1), data = rhc.matches_1)

summary(death_adj_m1)
```

    Call:
    coxph(formula = Surv(rep(1, 4368L), died) ~ treat_rhc + strata(matches_1), 
        data = rhc.matches_1, method = "exact")
    
      n= 4368, number of events= 2856 
    
                 coef exp(coef) se(coef)     z Pr(>|z|)    
    treat_rhc 0.23834   1.26914  0.06441 3.701 0.000215 ***

    Score (logrank) test = 13.76  on 1 df,   p=2e-04

The odds ratio in the `exp(coef)` section above is the average causal
effect estimate. It describes the odds of having an event (`died`) occur
associated with being a RHC subject (as identified by `treat_rhc`), as
compared to the odds of that event when a non-RHC subject. We can tidy
this with:

``` r

# ATT Matching Estimates for the Quantitative Outcome, Hospital Length of Stay

## With Match 1, in detail

Again, the variable which identifies the matches (called `matches_1`) is
set up as a factor, as it needs to be, and that I’m using the 1/0
version of treatment (so `treat_rhc` rather than `swang1`).

Our result for this quantitative outcome (`hospdays`) comes from a mixed
model where the matches are treated as a random factor, but the
treatment group is treated as a fixed factor, using the `lme4` package.

``` r
hospdays_adj_m1 <- lmer(hospdays ~ treat_rhc + (1 | matches_1),
                        data = rhc.matches_1)

`treat_rhc`), as compared to being a non-RHC subject. We can tidy this

# ATT Matching Estimates for the Time-to-Event Outcome, In-Study Survival

We’ll use a stratified Cox proportional hazards model to compare the
RHC/No RHC groups on our time-to-event outcome `survdays`, while
accounting for the matched pairs. The main result will be a relative
hazard rate estimate, with 95% CI. I will use the 0/1 numeric versions
of the event indicator (`died`), and of the treatment indicator
(`treat_rhc`).

## With Match 1, in detail

``` r
survdays_adj_m1 <- coxph(Surv(survdays, died) ~ treat_rhc + strata(matches_1), data=rhc.matches_1)
summary(survdays_adj_m1)
```

    Call:
    coxph(formula = Surv(survdays, died) ~ treat_rhc + strata(matches_1), 
        data = rhc.matches_1)
    
      n= 4368, number of events= 2856 
    
                 coef exp(coef) se(coef)     z Pr(>|z|)  
    treat_rhc 0.09205   1.09642  0.04551 2.023   0.0431 *
    ---
    Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
    
              exp(coef) exp(-coef) lower .95 upper .95
    treat_rhc     1.096     0.9121     1.003     1.199
    
    Concordance= 0.524  (se = 0.016 )
    Rsquare= 0.001   (max possible= 0.455 )
    Likelihood ratio test= 4.09  on 1 df,   p=0.04
    Wald test            = 4.09  on 1 df,   p=0.04
    Score (logrank) test = 4.09  on 1 df,   p=0.04

The hazard ratio in the `exp(coef)` section is the average causal effect
estimate. It describes the hazard for having an event (`died`) occur
associated with being a RHC subject (as identified by `treat_rhc`), as
compared to the hazard of that event when a non-RHC subject. We can tidy
this with:

``` r
tidy(survdays_adj_m1, exponentiate = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95)
```

    # A tibble: 1 x 7
      term      estimate std.error statistic p.value conf.low conf.high

# Sensitivity Analyses

## For the Binary Outcome, Death

The `rbounds` package can evaluate binary outcomes using the
`binarysens` and `Fishersens` functions. The `binarysens` function works
directly on a matched sample as developed using the Matching package.
For example, in our third match, based on the genetic search algorithm
with 1:1 matching without replacement, this is `match3`.

``` r
binarysens(match3, Gamma = 2, GammaInc = 0.1)
```

```

   2.0     0.00412     0.13169

```

At a 5% significance level, we retain significance up to a hidden bias
of \(\Gamma\) = 1.2, but not at \(\Gamma\) = 1.3. See the `toy_2019`
example discussed in Class 4, as well as Chapter 9 of Rosenbaum’s
*Observation and Experiment* for more details on interpretation of this
result.

We can also use this approach with other Matching results, including
Match 6, which is a 1:2 match with replacement.

``` r
binarysens(match6, Gamma = 3, GammaInc = 0.25)
```

```

```

Here, at a 5% significance level, we retain significance up to a hidden
bias of \(\Gamma\) = 2.5, but not at \(\Gamma\) = 2.75.

## For the Quantitative Outcome, In-Hospital Length of Stay

We have already used the `Match` function from the Matching package to
develop our matched samples. For our 1:1 matches, we need only run the
`psens` function from the `rbounds` package to obtain sensitivity
results. For example, in Match 3,

``` r
psens(match3, Gamma = 1.5, GammaInc = 0.1)
```

```

   1.3       0e+00      0.9495
   1.4       0e+00      0.9992
   1.5       0e+00      1.0000

 Note: Gamma is Odds of Differential Assignment To
 Treatment Due to Unobserved Factors 
 
```

At a 5% significance level, we retain significance up to a hidden bias
of \(\Gamma\) = 1.1, but not at \(\Gamma\) = 1.2. See the `toy_2019`
example discussed in Class 4, as well as Chapter 9 of Rosenbaum’s
*Observation and Experiment* for more details on interpretation of this
result.

For a matching with more than 1 control, we need to apply the `mcontrol`
function, which requires the use of the `data.prep` function from
`rbounds`. So, for example, in Match 6, which is a 1:2 greedy match (so
that each matched set has 3 patients in it, making the `group.size` =
3), we would have:

``` r
tmp <- data.prep(match6, group.size = 3)

mcontrol(tmp$Y, tmp$id, tmp$treat, group.size=3, Gamma = 1.5, GammaInc = 0.1)
```

```

   1.2           0      0.2357
   1.3           0      0.8049

   1.5           0      0.9999

 Note: Gamma is Odds of Differential Assignment To

```

Again, at a 5% significance level, we retain significance up to a hidden
bias of \(\Gamma\) = 1.1, but not at \(\Gamma\) = 1.2.

## For the Survival Outcome, In-Study Time to Death

In this setting, we would need to use the spreadsheet software provided
by Dr. Love. That software is designed only for 1:1 greedy matching
without replacement or weighting, which is the approach we took in Match
1. We need to identify, for each matched pair of subjects, whether that
pair’s set of results was:

  - that the RHC patient definitely survived longer than the non-RHC
    patient
  - that the non-RHC patient definitely survived longer than the RHC
    patient
  - that it is unclear which patient survived longer, due to censoring

Here is some very fussy code that accomplishes this counting. This could
probably be accomplished just as well with some sort of `case_when`
statement, but it’s a bit tricky.

``` r
a1 <- rhc.matches_1 %>% 
    select(matches_1, swang1, death, survdays) %>%
    arrange(matches_1) 
```

``` r
a2 <- unite(a1, situation, swang1, death, sep = "_", remove = TRUE)

a3 <- spread(a2, situation, survdays)

a4 <- a3 %>%
    filter(complete.cases(`No RHC_Yes`, `RHC_Yes`)) %>%
    mutate(result = ifelse(`RHC_Yes` > `No RHC_Yes`, "RHC lived longer", "No RHC lived longer"))

a5 <- a3 %>%
    filter(complete.cases(`No RHC_No`, `RHC_No`)) %>%
    mutate(result = "No clear winner")

a6 <- a3 %>%
    filter(complete.cases(`No RHC_No`, `RHC_Yes`)) %>%
    mutate(result = ifelse(`RHC_Yes` > `No RHC_No`, "No clear winner", "No RHC lived longer"))

a7 <- a3 %>%
    filter(complete.cases(`No RHC_Yes`, `RHC_No`)) %>%
    mutate(result = ifelse(`RHC_No` > `No RHC_Yes`, "RHC lived longer", "No clear winner"))

a8 <- bind_rows(a4, a5, a6, a7)

a8 %>% tabyl(result) %>% adorn_totals()
```

``` 
              result    n percent
     No clear winner  273 0.12500
 No RHC lived longer 1012 0.46337
    RHC lived longer  899 0.41163
               Total 2184 1.00000
```

So we have counts for the pairs where a clear winner is identified, and
we can enter the spreadsheet. We need the number of pairs with a clear
winner, and the number of pairs where the No RHC patient lived longer
than the RHC patient.
