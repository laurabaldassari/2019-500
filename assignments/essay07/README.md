# Essays in response to Rosenbaum PR Chapter 7 - some comments

## Prompt

> Provide an example of how an elaborate theory might be used to improve the design of an observational study with which you are familiar, either one you have been directly involved in, or one you've read about, or one you'd like to be able to do. Provide a basic description of your study's population, outcome, treatment and covariates so we can follow your logic. Be sure to demonstrate how you believe your elaborate theory will help to choose between alternative hypotheses, keeping in mind Cochran's suggestion that "the task of deciding between alternative hypotheses is made easier, since they may agree in predicting some consequences but will differ in others."

Thanks for working on this, all of you. Quoting the end of Chapter 7 ...

> An elaboration of a causal theory is most useful if its predictions help to distinguish between ignorable treatment assignment and a particularly plausible pattern of unobserved biases.

Some of the proposed elaborate theories provided by the students in the class either failed to convince me that multiple testable predictions would emerge from their adoption, or didn't really explain how those predictions would be formed in the first place. Some were more successful, and those listed below were a few of those that captured my attention a bit.

I [intend to] assess the effects of depression on clinical performance scores and imaging outcomes in patients with multiple  sclerosis. Depression  etiology  in  multiple  sclerosis  is  multifactorial,  in that  socioeconomic  status,  family  structure,  disability burden  due  to  disease, underlying   neuroanatomical   and   neurochemical   changes   could   all   affect development  and  severity  of  depression.  Similarly,  the  aforementioned  factors can also affect clinical performance scores and some imaging measures and vice versa. In  addition,  whether  depression  is  adequately  treated,  duration  and severity  of  depression  can  all  pose  confounding  effects  on  the  outcomes  [I intend]  to  measure.  To  address  these  potential  issues,  I  will  be  using  the following  elaborate  theory  to  test  several  hypotheses.  

- First,  I  need  to  achieve  a balanced match between the depressed vs. non-depressed population based on all  possible  covariates  that  may  contribute  to  neuroperformance  scores  and imaging  metrics;  only  then  can  I  assess  the  effect  of  presence  of  depression alone.  
- Second, in the group with depression, I will be again stratifying the groups in terms of severity of depression (mild, moderate, severe), and assess whether increasing severity of depression more negatively affects the outcome measures. 
- Third, in the same group with depression, I will use longitudinal data to evaluate the  consistency  of  depression  over  the  course  of  a  year,  and  assess  whether those  who  were  consistently  depressed  have  worse  outcomes.  

In  testing  these alternative  hypotheses,  I  should  be  able  to  address  the  biases  that  may  have contributed  to  depression  development,  severity  and  duration  that  would’ve otherwise confounded my results.

In Gasparrini,  Antonio,  et  al.  "Mortality  risk  attributable  to  high  and  low  ambient temperature: a multicountry observational study." *The Lancet* 386.9991 (2015): 369-375., the authors performed  an  interesting  multi-country  observational  study  looking  at mortality risk attributable to high and low ambient temperature. 

The team collected data for 384 locations in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Italy, Japan, USA and more. They controlled for the countries level of air pollution and humidity and restricting their research to non-external mortality. Their findings showed that extreme cold temperature was the major cause of mortality attributable to non-optimum weather, with extreme heat contributing far less. Their findings are also more convincing because they also did a systematic review of other observational studies of the same topic and found similar findings after meta-analysis. 

As  Rosenbaum  explained  in  Chapter  7,  the  correct  intersection  of  these  various  elements  (the researchers’  multi-country  observational  study  and  the  various  studies  included  in  the  meta-analysis) makes the conclusion more convincing. Further, when the individual pieces are solid on their own, and when the different studies exhibit a variety of weaknesses the pool of evidence becomes strong. To make this  theory  that  high  and  low  ambient  temperature  is  attributable  to  higher  mortality  risk  elaborate,  I would be interested to see the result of a prediction where a skeptic’s counterclaim predicts something entirely different about something we can observe. A plausible counterclaim could be that it is not the absolute low temperature that is causing the increased risk, but the shift in temperature from warmer to lower temperatures between the seasons. This could be tested by looking at countries that are historically stably cold throughout the year, and compare the mortality risks in the same part of the year to countries with the highest shift in temperature between the seasons. 

## from Student C

- Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are often administered to hospitalized patients to prevent heartburn and acid reflux during their hospitalization. PPIs act by inhibiting gastric acid production and are effective in preventing heartburn. It has been hypothesized that the alteration in gastric acidity may promote certain pathogens to survive in the stomach for longer periods.  Supporting this is some evidence that PPI use alters the composition of the bacterial populations inhabiting the gut thereby allowing certain bacterial pathogens to thrive. 
- *Clostridium difficile* is a spore-forming, Gram-positive bacterium implicated as the primary cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea. 

A few observational studies have shown a correlation between PPIs and C.difficile infection (CDI) but many other studies have not.  The association remains controversial and has been met with skepticism by the medical community. It is likely that patients on PPIs have other comorbidities and are generally sicker and more prone to CDI. An elaborate theory might be used here to improve the design of an observational study evaluating the association between PPI use and CDI.

If exposure to PPIs is associated with CDI, then we should expect 

1. more CDI in patients exposed to PPIs than matched patients not exposed to CDI 
2. more severe CDI in patients exposed to higher doses of PPIs than matched patients exposed to lower doses of PPIs 
3. more severe CDI in patients exposed to longer duration of PPIs than matched patients exposed to shorter duration of PPIs 

One can also study if patients on PPIs have a greater incidence of other hospital acquired infections (MRSA).
