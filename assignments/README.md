# Assignments for 500, Spring 2019

The course requires you to complete **three** types of "assignments". 

- The [Schedule page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md) lists all deliverables for the course.
- **NEW** As of 2019-02-03, the Observational Studies in Action assignment is **cancelled** for 2019.

## Course Project - 4 deliverables

1. a **proposal** which you will submit for my approval, first (**NEW**) as a draft  due in February (you should expect the need to do a revision or two) and then a final version for my approval in early March. 
    - Most projects will be done alone, but if you want to work as a two-person team, please gain my approval to do that by contacting me **no later than 2019-02-14**.
    - The exact deadlines for the initial draft and the final proposal have been **revised** on the [Course Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md).
2. an **update** verifying that you have the data and are proceeding appropriately at the start of April. 
    - The **revised** deadline for this update is on the [Course Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md).
3. a final 15-minute **presentation** (**NOTE NEW LENGTH**) to the class about your results accompanied by an **abstract**, and by R Markdown and HTML files that describe the work you did. 
    - All students will submit their **abstract** at the same time, before any presentations are given, as specified in the [Course Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md).
    - Presentation slides for each project are due the day before the actual presentation, as specified in the [Course Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md).
    - The presentations will be held during the last **three** classes of the semester, with 8-9 students in each session. You will be required to attend at least 14 of the 26 presentations, although you are encouraged to attend them all. At each presentation you attend, you will be providing feedback to your colleagues in the class.
    - We will [schedule the course presentations using this Google Form](http://bit.ly/500-2019-project-scheduling-form) that you'll complete by the early March deadline in the [Course Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md).
4. the **final presentation documents**, including everything you want me to see and incorporating any revisions to materials you presented earlier, are due as specified in the [Course Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md).

More details on the Course Project [are available here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/tree/master/projects).

## Essays in reaction to Rosenbaum's text - 5 deliverables

You'll write one essay (of 175-250 words) regarding each of several chapters from Rosenbaum's *Observation & Experiment* text, specifically Chapters 7, 8, 9, either 10 or 11, and 12, in response to [prompts I have provided](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/assignments/essayprompts.md). 

- **NEW** The essay deadlines have been revised, as indicated in the [Course Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md).

## Homework Assignments - 5 deliverables

You'll do **five homework assignments**, the first of which is due at the start of Class 2. These mostly require you to do some analyses (using R and R Markdown) on realistic but not real data I will provide. These are ungraded for quality - just for completion, and give you an opportunity to practice or develop coding skills in a low-stakes environment. 

- **NEW** The deadlines for HW 3 and 4 have been revised, as indicated below and in the [Course Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-500/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md).

## A Note on Feedback

500 is a very different course from 431-432 in terms of the "hands on" assistance that I make available to you as you're working on a homework assignment, in part because I don't have a TA for the course. In particular, I'm not going to review your code to be sure you're going in the right direction, even though I understand some of you have come to expect that from 431-432.

Instead, we discuss the HW assignments in class and I provide a detailed answer sketch after the fact. So if you have questions, please feel free to send them, and I'll answer sometimes, but what I am likely to say to anything I cannot resolve quickly for you (or think is worthy of deeper discussion as a group) is: 

1. That sounds like an excellent question to bring up on Thursday in class, and 
2. I'm going to let you (and everyone else) flounder a bit between now and our discussion of this HW in class.
